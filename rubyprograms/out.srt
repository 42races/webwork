1
00:02:06,457 --> 00:02:08,791
Ninety-one, 92....

2
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,461
-lt's down there.
-Where? If they catch us--

3
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:13,630
There's a million bottles
of booze in there.

4
00:02:13,797 --> 00:02:15,340
You think they're gonna miss one?

5
00:02:30,564 --> 00:02:32,690
Weather is with us, sir.

6
00:02:33,25 --> 00:02:36,235
We arrive in port in a couple of hours.

7
00:02:36,403 --> 00:02:38,29
Very good.

8
00:02:38,197 --> 00:02:39,989
You're welcome, sir.

9
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:48,998
Man, l never smelt anything like this.
Not even when you're in the crapper.

10
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:52,418
Oh, what, your shit smells like roses?

11
00:02:52,586 --> 00:02:53,920
Hey, look.

12
00:02:55,47 --> 00:02:56,923
I'll give you a hand.

13
00:03:03,97 --> 00:03:06,599
-Thought you said it was booze.
-That's what the papers said.

14
00:03:11,563 --> 00:03:13,773
Captain, we have a breach
in lower level. Look.

15
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:15,566
-Which section?
-1 01 .

16
00:03:16,402 --> 00:03:17,735
Fuck. Take the wheel.

17
00:03:17,903 --> 00:03:19,320
-Yes, sir.
-Fuck.

18
00:03:21,365 --> 00:03:23,616
Close the door! Get the masks.

19
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,958
Holy shit.

20
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:34,627
Take care of them.

21
00:04:19,89 --> 00:04:20,840
-Morning.
-Passport, please.

22
00:04:27,473 --> 00:04:28,514
Rough seas?

23
00:04:29,57 --> 00:04:32,351
The sea was smooth. The party was
a bit rough, if you know what l mean.

24
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,103
-lbiza.
-Yeah.

25
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:35,730
Thanks.

26
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:49,160
When I was a kid,
my father used to take me fishing.

27
00:04:49,328 --> 00:04:52,580
Never could figure out how he knew
where the fish were.

28
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:57,168
They were always exactly
where he said they would be.

29
00:05:21,944 --> 00:05:23,319
Security check.

30
00:05:23,695 --> 00:05:25,321
Do I look like a security risk?

31
00:05:25,572 --> 00:05:28,658
Please step out of the car and bring
your documents to the office.

32
00:05:29,493 --> 00:05:31,77
My documents are right here, sir.

33
00:05:31,245 --> 00:05:33,412
The computer is in the office.

34
00:05:34,915 --> 00:05:36,165
Her too.

35
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,42
She's sleeping.

36
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,3
-With her documents.
-Okay, sure.

37
00:05:55,894 --> 00:05:57,61
You're gonna lose it.

38
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:03,276
Close, inspector, you're close.

39
00:06:08,73 --> 00:06:10,74
That's a big one. Go left, go left.

40
00:06:12,619 --> 00:06:14,453
Don't let him get away.

41
00:06:19,84 --> 00:06:20,376
You're close.

42
00:06:25,716 --> 00:06:27,258
Go left, go left! Go right!

43
00:06:30,971 --> 00:06:33,139
Must be Moby Dick you hooked.
Need some help?

44
00:06:33,307 --> 00:06:34,432
No, thank you, Frank.

45
00:06:35,726 --> 00:06:38,978
I have been fishing these waters
since before you were born.

46
00:06:44,318 --> 00:06:47,778
You were close, inspector.
You were close.

47
00:06:51,325 --> 00:06:54,994
Good thing that we French have such
a highly developed sense of humor.

48
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:58,748
With all due respect, the French
think Jerry Lewis is a genius.

49
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:02,84
-Jerry Lewis is a genius.
-Dean was the genius.

50
00:07:02,252 --> 00:07:05,338
No, Dean just stood there
with a drink and a cigarette.

51
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:08,507
My point exactly.
Anyone can fall down and get a laugh.

52
00:07:08,675 --> 00:07:11,969
How many people can do it standing
still with a drink and a cigarette?

53
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,692
I am afraid our day of leisure
is cut short.

54
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,361
There is a mess in Marseilles.

55
00:07:28,528 --> 00:07:31,447
Some madman driving an Audi
at impossible speeds.

56
00:07:33,992 --> 00:07:35,910
Don't look at me.

57
00:07:36,78 --> 00:07:38,996
That is the first place
the chief told me to look.

58
00:07:39,164 --> 00:07:43,376
But l will tell him
you have the perfect alibi.

59
00:07:44,878 --> 00:07:46,754
As usual.

60
00:07:52,386 --> 00:07:53,678
Tarconi!

61
00:07:55,13 --> 00:07:56,472
-Please!
-l am sorry, Frank.

62
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,767
-lt's our first bite!
-Yeah, yeah.

63
00:08:00,477 --> 00:08:02,395
-Please.
-Yeah.

64
00:08:02,562 --> 00:08:04,63
Stop the boat. Come on.

65
00:08:04,231 --> 00:08:06,983
-No. No, Frank.
-Come on, please.

66
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,776
Purpose of your visit, Mr. Johnson?

67
00:08:51,528 --> 00:08:52,570
Business.

68
00:08:53,113 --> 00:08:54,363
What kind of business?

69
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:56,782
Environmental protection.

70
00:09:03,623 --> 00:09:04,790
Thank you.

71
00:09:07,85 --> 00:09:10,463
Mr. Minister, you're giving the opening
address at an EU conference...

72
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,382
...on environmental impact of industry
in Odessa tomorrow.

73
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,302
-What is top on your list of priorities?
-lt's a short list.

74
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,263
There's one item: the environment
and how to protect it.

75
00:09:19,431 --> 00:09:21,265
In the face of increasing pressure...

76
00:09:21,433 --> 00:09:24,393
...for industries to compete
successfully in a global economy...

77
00:09:24,561 --> 00:09:27,938
...that goal can sometimes come up
against some very harsh realities.

78
00:09:28,106 --> 00:09:31,108
Well, not as harsh as
a polluted and uninhabitable planet.

79
00:09:31,276 --> 00:09:32,985
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me now...

80
00:09:33,153 --> 00:09:36,405
...l have trees to save
and industrialists to disappoint.

81
00:09:40,77 --> 00:09:42,328
-Your speech for tomorrow.
-Any good?

82
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:46,707
-lt's going to piss off a lot of people.
-Excellent.

83
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:10,856
Hello?

84
00:10:12,25 --> 00:10:13,818
Mr. Minister?

85
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,861
Who is this?

86
00:10:16,196 --> 00:10:18,531
My name is not important.

87
00:10:18,698 --> 00:10:20,991
I've been put in charge of
the negotiations...

88
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,577
...you are engaged in with Ecocorp...

89
00:10:23,745 --> 00:10:27,39
...for issuance of their license
to do business in the Ukraine.

90
00:10:27,207 --> 00:10:29,708
You must be misinformed,
Mr. Whatever-Your-Name-ls.

91
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:32,2
I've terminated negotiations
permanently.

92
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,588
I think you will reconsider
that position...

93
00:10:34,756 --> 00:10:38,217
...once you have a chance to study
the documents in the envelope.

94
00:10:53,66 --> 00:10:55,67
I'll be in touch.

95
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:38,694
Yeah, there's been an accident.

96
00:11:39,29 --> 00:11:42,406
Send an ambulance,
8 Route de la Falaise.

97
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,218
Malcolm.

98
00:12:02,385 --> 00:12:04,94
Malcolm. Malcolm.

99
00:12:10,185 --> 00:12:12,645
I asked you for your price.
What is this?

100
00:12:12,812 --> 00:12:16,941
A man who might be interested
in taking the job. This man will.

101
00:12:17,442 --> 00:12:19,318
My boss said you're the man
for the job.

102
00:12:19,486 --> 00:12:21,153
Your boss got his facts wrong.

103
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:25,574
Two things you should know
about my boss:

104
00:12:25,742 --> 00:12:28,994
He never gets his facts wrong,
he never takes no for an answer.

105
00:12:29,162 --> 00:12:31,247
Well, there's a first time
for everything.

106
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,967
Well, not this time.

107
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:51,267
You don't wanna do this.

108
00:12:51,434 --> 00:12:55,396
I don't think you're in a position to
tell me what l do and don't wanna do.

109
00:12:55,563 --> 00:12:58,565
You have 1 0 seconds
to change your mind.

110
00:13:02,946 --> 00:13:06,365
I'll give you five seconds
to remove your hand.

111
00:14:06,217 --> 00:14:08,344
Malcolm. Malcolm.

112
00:14:08,511 --> 00:14:09,553
You hear me?

113
00:14:12,182 --> 00:14:14,558
Mal, I said drop in anytime,
but I didn't mean....

114
00:14:14,893 --> 00:14:17,603
-Nowhere else to go.
-Just take it easy, okay?

115
00:14:19,272 --> 00:14:20,564
Don't move me from the car.

116
00:14:20,732 --> 00:14:24,735
-lt's just till the ambulance arrives.
-No ambulance.

117
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,530
You need a doctor, you've been shot.
I can't take care of this.

118
00:14:30,408 --> 00:14:32,910
Not far from car.

119
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:35,454
Relax.

120
00:14:35,789 --> 00:14:40,459
Just try to stay calm.
We'll have you fixed up in no time.

121
00:14:51,471 --> 00:14:53,514
He's inside. Quick, it's serious.

122
00:14:58,61 --> 00:14:59,103
Sir?

123
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:02,481
-You wanna be careful moving him.
-We know our job, okay?

124
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:05,192
Sir, can you hear me?

125
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,944
This car.... No....

126
00:15:07,112 --> 00:15:08,654
If you hear me, press my hand.

127
00:15:09,72 --> 00:15:10,406
The car....

128
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,541
Am l in heaven?

129
00:16:03,251 --> 00:16:05,210
Actually, you're in a bit of the shit.

130
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:08,380
You'll help me out of it?

131
00:16:09,48 --> 00:16:10,841
That depends on
how deep you're in.

132
00:16:11,176 --> 00:16:14,344
-Don't trust anyone.
-Couldn't agree with you more.

133
00:16:16,556 --> 00:16:18,140
-Come on.
-No! Don't leave the car!

134
00:16:18,308 --> 00:16:21,518
-What's so special about the car?
-Not the car.

135
00:16:33,656 --> 00:16:35,491
Wait!

136
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,270
I told you.

137
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:12,194
Don't trust anyone.

138
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,280
I told you.

139
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:09,960
I took the liberty
of bringing your suit.

140
00:18:10,128 --> 00:18:12,337
It's what you wear when
you're working, correct?

141
00:18:12,505 --> 00:18:15,173
Correct. But l'm not working.

142
00:18:15,675 --> 00:18:18,844
-You see, boss? l told you.
-Please, Joseph.

143
00:18:19,512 --> 00:18:23,515
Your approach was not very effective in
presenting our proposal the first time.

144
00:18:23,683 --> 00:18:25,267
Thank you.

145
00:18:25,893 --> 00:18:26,935
As l was saying...

146
00:18:27,103 --> 00:18:30,272
...we came to you in good faith.
You said you were unavailable.

147
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,899
We contracted with the man
whose number you gave us.

148
00:18:33,67 --> 00:18:34,651
He proved to be ineffective.

149
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:38,113
And now I am left
with unfinished business.

150
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:40,616
The way l see it, you're responsible.

151
00:18:41,75 --> 00:18:43,160
I understand your point of view.

152
00:18:43,328 --> 00:18:44,536
But l'm still unavailable.

153
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:48,40
Boss, can l say something?

154
00:18:50,835 --> 00:18:53,86
Anyone else wanna say something?

155
00:18:56,215 --> 00:18:57,758
Good.

156
00:18:58,9 --> 00:19:00,52
Find me a smarter one.

157
00:19:02,388 --> 00:19:04,431
You have three seconds
to change your mind...

158
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:07,392
...or you're gonna
be permanently unavailable.

159
00:19:08,19 --> 00:19:09,603
One.

160
00:19:11,856 --> 00:19:12,898
Two.

161
00:19:16,69 --> 00:19:17,194
One condition.

162
00:19:20,281 --> 00:19:21,823
I'm listening.

163
00:19:22,492 --> 00:19:24,743
I drive my own car.

164
00:19:25,995 --> 00:19:27,496
Deal.

165
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,211
In anticipation of your answer, we took
the liberty of bringing your car.

166
00:19:34,379 --> 00:19:38,340
Changed the oil, gave it a tune-up,
took out all the non-essential material.

167
00:19:38,508 --> 00:19:42,94
Left the switch-over license plates.
Love that.

168
00:19:42,261 --> 00:19:44,554
Replaced the GPS
with one of our own.

169
00:19:44,722 --> 00:19:46,598
Preprogrammed.
More efficient that way.

170
00:19:47,16 --> 00:19:51,61
Why I was so insistent on using only
the best man for this assignment?

171
00:19:53,773 --> 00:19:56,233
We're playing
in a much larger game here.

172
00:19:56,401 --> 00:20:01,113
Don't think of this as just another job.
Think of it as a mission.

173
00:20:03,116 --> 00:20:05,951
I'm so pleased to find we share
the same approach to our work.

174
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:08,245
I make a deal, that's the deal.
Just like you.

175
00:20:08,413 --> 00:20:11,164
You don't like names. Neither do l.
We're both precise.

176
00:20:11,332 --> 00:20:14,459
Neither one of us has any interest
in what we're paid to do...

177
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:18,630
...beyond what we are paid to do.
Those are your rules, right?

178
00:20:26,806 --> 00:20:28,473
You forgot one.

179
00:20:29,16 --> 00:20:31,977
-l work alone.
-l thought you might like the company.

180
00:20:32,395 --> 00:20:34,730
Thought you wanted me
to complete a mission.

181
00:20:36,941 --> 00:20:38,775
You're right. l do.

182
00:20:41,487 --> 00:20:42,738
Wait.

183
00:20:44,615 --> 00:20:46,575
What, you wanna change the rules?

184
00:20:48,161 --> 00:20:50,954
Every rule has an exception.
Let's make one for today.

185
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:55,333
You're the boss.

186
00:20:58,87 --> 00:21:00,130
Anything else?

187
00:21:00,757 --> 00:21:02,591
The jewelry.
Anything I should know?

188
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,889
You remember those jokers
trying to blow up airliners...

189
00:21:09,56 --> 00:21:11,933
...by sneaking liquids through
and combining them onboard?

190
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:14,19
Same principle, just refined.

191
00:21:14,187 --> 00:21:15,937
Twenty-five feet from the car...

192
00:21:16,105 --> 00:21:19,524
...yellow light comes on,
signaling the first liquid is ready.

193
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:21,526
Fifty feet, orange.

194
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,70
Second liquid
flows into the chamber.

195
00:21:24,238 --> 00:21:27,240
Seventy-five feet,
you're gonna see red.

196
00:21:32,455 --> 00:21:34,247
Time to go.

197
00:21:34,707 --> 00:21:38,460
This phone is programmed
to call only one number, mine.

198
00:21:39,504 --> 00:21:43,381
When you pass the first toll on the
road going north, call me, all right?

199
00:21:44,467 --> 00:21:47,469
Money for gas and food.

200
00:21:47,637 --> 00:21:48,887
Any other questions?

201
00:22:20,461 --> 00:22:22,671
Would you mind
buckling your seat belt?

202
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:36,768
Don't suppose you wanna tell me
what this is all about?

203
00:22:42,525 --> 00:22:44,442
Great.

204
00:23:00,126 --> 00:23:02,752
Ocean Pearl
requesting cargo clearance.

205
00:23:04,422 --> 00:23:06,965
The papers are with
the environmental agency.

206
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,259
Drop anchor and wait to dock.

207
00:23:09,427 --> 00:23:12,95
-We'll inform you when they're signed.
-Okay.

208
00:23:21,647 --> 00:23:23,356
I know what happened to you.

209
00:23:23,524 --> 00:23:25,817
But what happened to Frank?

210
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:35,660
Colonel Medved over at lntelligence
has been given all the information.

211
00:23:36,287 --> 00:23:37,662
He knows it's top priority.

212
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,415
He wants you to know
he has his best men on it.

213
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:42,792
He'll keep it out of official channels.

214
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,671
He suggests you buy
as much time as you can.

215
00:24:42,61 --> 00:24:46,815
Look, l don't know what your part in all
this is or isn't. And l don't really care.

216
00:24:46,983 --> 00:24:49,317
You were here first,
you know more than l do...

217
00:24:49,485 --> 00:24:51,236
...download me on what you know.

218
00:24:51,404 --> 00:24:52,988
I know nothing.

219
00:24:53,155 --> 00:24:55,407
How did you know Malcolm?

220
00:24:55,783 --> 00:24:56,825
I didn't.

221
00:24:57,368 --> 00:25:00,245
You just happened to end up in a car
with a man you don't know?

222
00:25:02,415 --> 00:25:04,541
I'm now in a car
with man l don't know.

223
00:25:06,377 --> 00:25:09,45
Aren't you supposed to make a call?

224
00:25:15,386 --> 00:25:16,886
Nice to hear from you.

225
00:25:17,54 --> 00:25:20,140
You can skip the pleasantries.
Just give me the code.

226
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:22,100
1-1-2-6.

227
00:25:26,313 --> 00:25:28,773
Call me when you arrive.

228
00:25:30,526 --> 00:25:32,944
What's in Budapest?

229
00:25:33,112 --> 00:25:35,405
Goulash. Beer.

230
00:25:42,371 --> 00:25:43,621
All right.

231
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:46,624
Let's rewind here,
start with the proper introductions.

232
00:25:47,251 --> 00:25:49,794
What happened
to the rule of no names?

233
00:25:49,962 --> 00:25:53,89
I'm suspending that rule
for the moment.

234
00:25:56,135 --> 00:25:58,344
I'm Frank Martin.

235
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:02,98
And your name is?

236
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:07,645
What matters, my name?

237
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:11,149
Well, we're in this situation together.

238
00:26:11,692 --> 00:26:13,276
No.

239
00:26:15,905 --> 00:26:19,657
We're sitting here with two exploding
bracelets on, going to the same place.

240
00:26:20,826 --> 00:26:22,786
I'd call that being
in the same situation.

241
00:26:23,204 --> 00:26:25,830
It's not. They are going to kill you.

242
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:29,834
I'm aware of that.

243
00:26:30,753 --> 00:26:33,797
In all probability, after they kill me,
you're next on the list.

244
00:26:33,964 --> 00:26:37,509
Now, if l'm gonna keep that from
happening, I'm gonna need a little help.

245
00:26:37,676 --> 00:26:40,345
From the top. We have this problem.

246
00:26:40,513 --> 00:26:42,514
You think I don't know
it's a problem?

247
00:26:42,973 --> 00:26:44,849
I look stupid to you?

248
00:26:45,518 --> 00:26:48,61
I didn't say you were stupid.

249
00:26:49,772 --> 00:26:51,189
But we have a problem...

250
00:26:51,357 --> 00:26:55,26
...and you're not being very helpful
in participating in the solution of it.

251
00:26:56,695 --> 00:26:58,988
I don't want to talk anymore.

252
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,622
Fine.

253
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,720
What did you say your name was?

254
00:27:23,681 --> 00:27:26,683
Frank. Frank Martin.

255
00:27:27,643 --> 00:27:29,811
Frank Martin.

256
00:27:30,146 --> 00:27:32,230
Valentina.

257
00:27:35,234 --> 00:27:37,777
Pleased to meet you.

258
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:35,960
The gentlemen
from Ecocorp are here.

259
00:28:37,379 --> 00:28:38,588
Show them in.

260
00:28:46,347 --> 00:28:47,388
Gentlemen.

261
00:28:50,643 --> 00:28:52,185
Mr. Minister.

262
00:28:52,353 --> 00:28:55,271
We'd like to thank you for
reconsidering our proposal...

263
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:58,399
-...on such short notice.
-You make it very hard not to.

264
00:28:58,567 --> 00:29:02,237
Well, yes. We do have a reputation
of not taking no for an answer.

265
00:29:03,155 --> 00:29:04,656
Here are the contracts.

266
00:29:06,492 --> 00:29:07,575
All in order.

267
00:29:08,369 --> 00:29:10,453
We were told the ships
couldn't be cleared...

268
00:29:10,621 --> 00:29:12,664
...unless you personally
signed off on them.

269
00:29:12,831 --> 00:29:14,165
Ships?

270
00:29:14,708 --> 00:29:16,167
I thought there was only one.

271
00:29:16,335 --> 00:29:18,836
Oh, well, here's the thing.

272
00:29:19,4 --> 00:29:21,798
In order to make the venture
more profitable...

273
00:29:21,966 --> 00:29:24,968
...we need to process the material
in a volume that makes sense.

274
00:29:25,135 --> 00:29:26,803
How many ships
are we talking about?

275
00:29:26,971 --> 00:29:30,765
Plus the one in the port
waiting on clearance, eight.

276
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,600
Eight.

277
00:29:32,935 --> 00:29:34,143
This year.

278
00:29:35,354 --> 00:29:38,439
Protecting the environment
is a long-term commitment.

279
00:29:38,607 --> 00:29:40,650
You've said so yourself, haven't you?

280
00:29:40,818 --> 00:29:43,361
And l will do again tomorrow
in Odessa...

281
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:46,447
...where I will sign these.

282
00:29:47,366 --> 00:29:50,201
We were really hoping to
settle this today.

283
00:29:50,369 --> 00:29:54,747
I want to review them, now that
there are some addendums.

284
00:29:54,915 --> 00:29:57,125
Twenty-four hours
doesn't make a difference...

285
00:29:57,293 --> 00:29:59,711
...on such a long-term
commitment, will it?

286
00:30:00,421 --> 00:30:03,172
No, of course not.

287
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:07,385
Then l will see you tomorrow
in Odessa. Let's say 9 a.m.

288
00:30:13,225 --> 00:30:14,642
Yes.

289
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,561
Okay, l'll stay.

290
00:30:16,729 --> 00:30:18,396
-But the material is leaking.
-And?

291
00:30:18,564 --> 00:30:21,190
-We won't be able to hide it.
-l'll take care of it.

292
00:30:21,358 --> 00:30:22,692
If ever they check....

293
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,194
Easy. The deal will be closed
very soon.

294
00:30:25,362 --> 00:30:27,30
Twenty-four hours. No more.

295
00:30:36,81 --> 00:30:39,917
-Yes?
-l've bought you another 24 hours.

296
00:30:40,85 --> 00:30:42,420
You have until tomorrow, 9 a.m.

297
00:30:42,588 --> 00:30:44,422
That should be
more than enough time.

298
00:30:45,7 --> 00:30:46,883
Do you have a lead?

299
00:30:47,51 --> 00:30:48,885
Better than a lead.

300
00:30:49,678 --> 00:30:50,720
A location.

301
00:31:29,259 --> 00:31:31,260
I'm hungry.

302
00:31:32,262 --> 00:31:34,806
We're 1 00 kilometers
from beer and sausage.

303
00:31:36,225 --> 00:31:38,643
I don't like sausage.

304
00:31:41,438 --> 00:31:43,398
What would you like?

305
00:31:47,528 --> 00:31:49,195
Veal.

306
00:31:49,363 --> 00:31:51,322
Roast, with carrots...

307
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:52,949
...and beets.

308
00:31:54,493 --> 00:31:57,578
In gravy, with Madeira in stock.

309
00:31:57,746 --> 00:31:59,38
Nothing to start?

310
00:32:02,584 --> 00:32:04,585
A salad.

311
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:08,464
Greens tossed with balsamic.

312
00:32:08,632 --> 00:32:10,425
From Modena.

313
00:32:10,592 --> 00:32:12,9
Aged?

314
00:32:12,177 --> 00:32:14,178
Of course, aged.

315
00:32:17,182 --> 00:32:19,225
And for dessert?

316
00:32:20,477 --> 00:32:22,103
Sachertorte.

317
00:32:22,604 --> 00:32:25,148
With whipped cream or without?

318
00:32:26,483 --> 00:32:27,859
With.

319
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,486
To drink?

320
00:32:32,364 --> 00:32:33,614
Wine.

321
00:32:33,782 --> 00:32:35,616
Tokaj, perhaps?

322
00:32:36,118 --> 00:32:37,201
Ice wine.

323
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,204
Of course.

324
00:32:52,50 --> 00:32:54,886
-What are you doing?
-Seeing a man about some jewelry.

325
00:33:06,565 --> 00:33:08,149
He's gone off the reservation.

326
00:33:10,486 --> 00:33:13,821
Send someone to get him back on.

327
00:33:14,448 --> 00:33:16,407
Don't kill him.

328
00:33:43,101 --> 00:33:45,770
Frank. lt's so good to see you,
mein Freund.

329
00:33:46,21 --> 00:33:48,356
Good to see you too, Otto.

330
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:51,234
You didn't mention
you bring company.

331
00:33:51,735 --> 00:33:52,902
It's not really company.

332
00:33:53,403 --> 00:33:55,71
It's...

333
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,365
...complicated.

334
00:33:57,533 --> 00:34:00,535
With you, it's always complicated.
You can tell me about it...

335
00:34:00,702 --> 00:34:04,455
...over a nice schnitzel
with Kartoffelsalat I have prepared.

336
00:34:05,82 --> 00:34:07,291
Hey, Otto, you know
I love your schnitzel...

337
00:34:07,459 --> 00:34:09,919
...but we need to get rid of this first.

338
00:34:12,422 --> 00:34:15,925
Binary free-form
magnetic-resolution technology.

339
00:34:16,385 --> 00:34:17,635
English, please, Otto.

340
00:34:19,54 --> 00:34:21,97
There's a program the
Pentagon has funded...

341
00:34:21,265 --> 00:34:24,392
...through one of their
subsidiary front companies...

342
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,937
...that's been experimenting with
this new kind of weaponry...

343
00:34:28,105 --> 00:34:30,773
...based on the theory
of magnetic attraction.

344
00:34:30,941 --> 00:34:32,984
Very hush-hush stuff.

345
00:34:34,653 --> 00:34:37,572
I didn't realize you were in the loop
on the Pentagon hush-hush.

346
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:39,824
You wouldn't believe
what you can discover...

347
00:34:39,992 --> 00:34:42,159
...walking through the Internet.

348
00:34:42,327 --> 00:34:44,620
You wanna see the
invasion plans for lran?

349
00:34:45,38 --> 00:34:46,831
Maybe some other time.

350
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:50,459
Right now we need to get this thing off
without blowing myself to lran.

351
00:34:50,627 --> 00:34:53,87
I don't wanna bother you
with the details...

352
00:34:53,255 --> 00:34:57,842
...but usually there's
a transmitter plate close by.

353
00:35:04,16 --> 00:35:05,516
You should not be doing this.

354
00:35:05,684 --> 00:35:07,685
First you don't talk,
now you offer advice.

355
00:35:07,853 --> 00:35:10,354
Not advice. A warning.

356
00:35:10,939 --> 00:35:12,481
Well, a little late for warnings,
don't you think?

357
00:35:19,531 --> 00:35:20,698
I agree with you.

358
00:35:25,287 --> 00:35:26,871
You're off course.

359
00:35:32,961 --> 00:35:35,588
-Should l?
-Yeah, you should.

360
00:35:41,553 --> 00:35:43,179
Look, fellas...

361
00:35:43,972 --> 00:35:46,891
...some things in the car
were a bit off, needed checking.

362
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,645
In my profession,
a man is only as good as the car.

363
00:35:50,812 --> 00:35:54,65
You take care of the car,
the car will take care of you.

364
00:35:56,193 --> 00:35:58,569
The boss says, "Back on the road."

365
00:35:59,29 --> 00:36:00,404
Frank?

366
00:36:01,156 --> 00:36:02,198
Keep at it.

367
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,77
Back in the car, Frank.

368
00:36:06,745 --> 00:36:07,953
No.

369
00:37:19,317 --> 00:37:21,444
-Find it?
-Not yet.

370
00:38:38,146 --> 00:38:39,772
You're the smart one?

371
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,566
No. I'm the big one.

372
00:39:34,744 --> 00:39:36,78
Not so big anymore, are you?

373
00:39:58,643 --> 00:40:00,477
Found it.

374
00:40:04,691 --> 00:40:07,234
-The transmitter.
-Can you remove it?

375
00:40:09,696 --> 00:40:10,738
It's wired.

376
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:13,73
If l do:

377
00:41:11,7 --> 00:41:13,50
You fight good.

378
00:41:16,54 --> 00:41:18,222
But you tie bad.

379
00:41:23,812 --> 00:41:24,853
Where are you going?

380
00:41:25,355 --> 00:41:27,147
Tired.

381
00:41:28,316 --> 00:41:30,567
That's why I prefer to deal with cars.

382
00:41:31,403 --> 00:41:33,70
That makes two of us.

383
00:41:33,571 --> 00:41:36,573
What do you want me to do
when they--? When they wake up?

384
00:41:36,741 --> 00:41:39,868
Probably best to take
the rest of the day off.

385
00:41:58,179 --> 00:41:59,346
I'm not amused.

386
00:41:59,514 --> 00:42:01,432
You'd be less amused
if you ended up dead.

387
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,18
If you wanted me dead, I'd be dead.
You need me.

388
00:42:04,185 --> 00:42:07,21
You want me to complete the job,
I need some clarification.

389
00:42:08,606 --> 00:42:09,773
I'm listening.

390
00:42:10,191 --> 00:42:11,358
In person.

391
00:42:11,526 --> 00:42:12,985
We've already done in person.

392
00:42:13,153 --> 00:42:15,279
Well, not to my satisfaction,
apparently.

393
00:42:15,989 --> 00:42:18,949
Right now, my satisfaction
should be your main concern.

394
00:42:19,993 --> 00:42:22,578
Same place. One hour.
Wait for my call.

395
00:43:19,427 --> 00:43:20,511
Hello?

396
00:43:20,678 --> 00:43:22,679
You've disappointed me.

397
00:43:22,847 --> 00:43:25,933
You won't be the first
and you won't be the last.

398
00:43:26,101 --> 00:43:30,896
-l told you l wanted to do this in person.
-That won't be necessary. You see...

399
00:43:31,64 --> 00:43:33,190
...since our little chat
at the beginning...

400
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:36,860
...l've been thinking l don't need
the best for this mundane assignment.

401
00:43:37,28 --> 00:43:39,238
Any idiot with
a driver's license will do.

402
00:43:39,405 --> 00:43:42,491
So in the words of the
great American, Donald Trump:

403
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:46,36
I'm sorry, but you're fired.

404
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:33,417
Who are you?

405
00:44:33,751 --> 00:44:36,420
-Your new chauffeur.
-l want the old one back.

406
00:44:36,588 --> 00:44:38,922
He's about to go to pieces.

407
00:45:47,367 --> 00:45:48,742
You're fired.

408
00:45:52,538 --> 00:45:53,622
How was your nap?

409
00:45:53,957 --> 00:45:56,375
Restful. How was your phone call?

410
00:45:56,542 --> 00:45:59,44
Brief. Fasten your seat belt.

411
00:46:10,932 --> 00:46:11,974
Tarconi.

412
00:46:12,141 --> 00:46:13,183
It's me.

413
00:46:14,352 --> 00:46:16,103
I was wondering
when you would call.

414
00:46:16,271 --> 00:46:17,521
I've been busy.

415
00:46:17,689 --> 00:46:20,357
Let me guess. ln Budapest?

416
00:46:21,567 --> 00:46:22,943
You've been busy too.

417
00:46:23,403 --> 00:46:26,280
Never a problem keeping that way
with a friend like you.

418
00:46:26,447 --> 00:46:29,324
So l don't have to be redundant,
tell me what you know.

419
00:46:29,492 --> 00:46:31,952
There is a black Mercedes
also in Budapest.

420
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,204
Probably not occupied
by friends of yours.

421
00:46:34,372 --> 00:46:37,40
That is what I know.
Now tell me what you know.

422
00:46:37,834 --> 00:46:41,211
I have two bags in the back
and a girl in the front.

423
00:46:41,379 --> 00:46:43,297
Russian, I think.

424
00:46:43,506 --> 00:46:45,716
I don't know what she
has to do with anything.

425
00:46:45,883 --> 00:46:47,884
Have you tried asking her?

426
00:46:48,52 --> 00:46:50,137
-Now, why didn't l think of that?
-Sorry.

427
00:46:50,305 --> 00:46:52,55
Of course you've asked.
And she says?

428
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,974
I'm going to die.

429
00:46:54,142 --> 00:46:56,476
Typical. Russians.

430
00:46:56,644 --> 00:46:58,895
They are so dark.

431
00:46:59,63 --> 00:47:02,566
I remember, in school,
reading Dostoyevsky and thinking...

432
00:47:02,734 --> 00:47:05,444
...when do these people laugh?

433
00:47:05,611 --> 00:47:07,321
One page after the other...

434
00:47:07,488 --> 00:47:10,490
...misery and suffering
like you wouldn't believe, Frank.

435
00:47:10,658 --> 00:47:14,77
Inspector, can we save the
literature lesson? l'm blinking here.

436
00:47:14,245 --> 00:47:15,495
Is that code?

437
00:47:16,414 --> 00:47:19,875
No, it's some bracelet
they accessorized us with.

438
00:47:20,43 --> 00:47:22,294
Wired to explode
if we get too far from the car.

439
00:47:22,462 --> 00:47:23,503
They?

440
00:47:24,172 --> 00:47:25,255
Some American.

441
00:47:25,423 --> 00:47:28,300
Can you be more specific?
A name? A number?

442
00:47:28,468 --> 00:47:29,551
Nothing.

443
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:31,928
Why do you always
make it so easy, Frank?

444
00:47:32,96 --> 00:47:33,847
It's my nature.

445
00:47:34,15 --> 00:47:35,891
Where are you? I will come there.

446
00:47:36,59 --> 00:47:38,560
That's not a good idea.
They have me on a short leash.

447
00:47:38,728 --> 00:47:41,605
I can't be of much help
if you do not give me something.

448
00:47:43,191 --> 00:47:45,359
How close are you to a computer?

449
00:47:49,155 --> 00:47:50,280
Yes, Frank?

450
00:47:50,448 --> 00:47:53,283
That wasn't very nice,
back there in the market.

451
00:47:53,451 --> 00:47:56,286
You were the one
who broke the rules, not me.

452
00:47:56,454 --> 00:47:58,580
Point well taken.

453
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:02,376
That makes us even. What say
we start with a clean slate?

454
00:48:02,543 --> 00:48:05,712
So this call is about
kiss-and-make-up, then?

455
00:48:06,297 --> 00:48:07,422
More or less.

456
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:10,509
You have what l need
to get the bracelet off...

457
00:48:10,676 --> 00:48:13,553
...l have the packages
you need delivered.

458
00:48:14,555 --> 00:48:17,140
Here are the new coordinates,
then: 2-6-1 2.

459
00:48:17,475 --> 00:48:18,975
That'll take you to the place...

460
00:48:19,143 --> 00:48:21,478
...where we can have a
conclusion to this business.

461
00:48:21,646 --> 00:48:23,438
I look forward to it.

462
00:48:29,404 --> 00:48:30,737
Frank.

463
00:48:30,905 --> 00:48:32,155
Did you get it?

464
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,79
Got the signal. Give us a little time...

465
00:48:39,247 --> 00:48:41,498
...and we should have his number
and location.

466
00:48:42,834 --> 00:48:44,626
Your new phone, sir.

467
00:48:50,466 --> 00:48:53,468
-Anything else?
-No.

468
00:48:56,931 --> 00:49:00,684
Frank, do you know where
the signal is taking you?

469
00:49:11,28 --> 00:49:15,198
I know restaurant there.
Fish like you never had.

470
00:49:15,366 --> 00:49:18,535
Roasted with small carrots
and black pepper.

471
00:49:18,703 --> 00:49:21,329
Romanian wine, not so good.

472
00:49:22,874 --> 00:49:25,750
But for the last meal,
could be worse.

473
00:49:28,212 --> 00:49:31,548
You really should begin
to think more positive.

474
00:49:31,716 --> 00:49:34,92
I'm realist.

475
00:49:36,12 --> 00:49:38,722
My friend was right when he said
you were doom and gloom.

476
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:41,766
What means "doom and gloom"?

477
00:49:41,934 --> 00:49:44,895
You know, you only see
the horrible and the terrible.

478
00:49:45,62 --> 00:49:48,64
Your friend, where does he get this?
He doesn't know me.

479
00:49:48,274 --> 00:49:51,568
He was talking about you in general.
Russians, as a people.

480
00:49:51,736 --> 00:49:53,904
I'm not Russian. l'm Ukrainian.

481
00:49:54,572 --> 00:49:55,697
Excuse me.

482
00:49:55,865 --> 00:49:59,951
Not excused. We're different people.
We're different here...

483
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:01,328
...and here.

484
00:50:06,959 --> 00:50:11,4
Me, personally, I think there's
a little bit of an optimist in you.

485
00:50:12,548 --> 00:50:14,966
How you can make such a statement?
You don't know me.

486
00:50:16,928 --> 00:50:19,304
Well, l see
you're putting makeup on.

487
00:50:19,472 --> 00:50:23,16
If you were so convinced
we was gonna die, why bother?

488
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,980
What does looking good
have to do with dying?

489
00:50:35,738 --> 00:50:37,864
Hello.

490
00:50:38,824 --> 00:50:40,33
What's that?

491
00:50:40,201 --> 00:50:42,702
Souvenirs from lbiza.
Do you want one?

492
00:50:42,954 --> 00:50:46,39
No, thank you. And neither do you.
We need to stay sharp.

493
00:50:48,84 --> 00:50:49,793
Okay.

494
00:50:54,882 --> 00:50:56,424
You stay sharp.

495
00:50:56,592 --> 00:50:59,469
I stay, how you say? Optimist?

496
00:50:59,929 --> 00:51:03,306
Give me that.
Give me that thing. Give me the pill!

497
00:51:06,602 --> 00:51:07,894
Give me that--

498
00:51:12,984 --> 00:51:15,151
Jesus.

499
00:51:17,572 --> 00:51:19,239
Great.

500
00:51:21,325 --> 00:51:24,619
-Just great.
-Come on, Frank Martin, lighten up.

501
00:51:24,787 --> 00:51:26,663
I should?
How about when those pills hit?

502
00:51:26,831 --> 00:51:29,499
You're gonna be lighting up
like a goddamn Christmas tree.

503
00:51:29,667 --> 00:51:30,792
That would be nice.

504
00:51:31,335 --> 00:51:33,837
Boring. Boring. Boring?

505
00:51:34,5 --> 00:51:35,964
Oh, yeah.

506
00:52:14,211 --> 00:52:16,4
You should stay in the car.

507
00:52:16,297 --> 00:52:18,673
You want me to pee in car?

508
00:52:23,929 --> 00:52:26,139
Okay. Go on.

509
00:52:30,19 --> 00:52:31,394
You remember.

510
00:52:57,588 --> 00:53:24,656
Don't.

511
00:53:45,302 --> 00:53:46,302
Oh, no.

512
00:54:24,508 --> 00:54:28,11
-Stop, all right?
-Why? l don't drive.

513
00:54:28,429 --> 00:54:29,471
I want to have fun.

514
00:54:29,638 --> 00:54:33,16
I want to be happy. You should
try happy instead of so serious.

515
00:54:33,309 --> 00:54:36,352
It's important to stay positive,
like you say, yeah?

516
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,773
-Drink with me, Frankie.
-l don't want a drink.

517
00:54:42,526 --> 00:54:45,28
Now who is all gloomy and doomy?

518
00:54:45,196 --> 00:54:47,197
I say it right? Gloomy doomy?

519
00:54:48,199 --> 00:54:50,366
Come on, get in the car.

520
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:53,536
I am free, like a bird.

521
00:55:01,504 --> 00:55:03,296
The girl! Come on! Faster!

522
00:55:12,56 --> 00:55:14,682
-l have lost my friend!
-l'll buy you a new one.

523
00:55:29,31 --> 00:55:31,74
Have any idea
why we have a car on our ass?

524
00:55:32,368 --> 00:55:33,743
I don't know. l don't care.

525
00:55:36,80 --> 00:55:38,498
-You mind?
-First you say I'm doom and gloom...

526
00:55:38,666 --> 00:55:41,543
...and now you tell me do not
be happy? Make up your mind.

527
00:56:31,218 --> 00:56:33,678
-Yes, Frank?
-l thought we had an agreement.

528
00:56:33,846 --> 00:56:35,138
We do.

529
00:56:35,306 --> 00:56:37,223
It had nothing to do
with a car on my ass.

530
00:56:38,809 --> 00:56:43,313
I don't have anything to do with that.
Someone else has issues with you?

531
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,315
Likely.

532
00:56:48,27 --> 00:56:51,404
What l think is that there are
other forces at work here.

533
00:56:51,572 --> 00:56:53,990
Let me check into it,
see what l can find out.

534
00:56:54,158 --> 00:56:55,825
What do I do in the meantime?

535
00:56:55,993 --> 00:56:58,161
Drive faster.

536
00:57:32,613 --> 00:57:33,947
What the hell is he doing?

537
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,761
There!

538
00:58:38,929 --> 00:58:40,346
He's down there!

539
00:58:45,894 --> 00:58:47,228
I'm hungry.

540
00:58:47,396 --> 00:58:49,605
Should have thought
about a sandwich, not vodka.

541
00:58:51,817 --> 00:58:52,900
Look!

542
00:58:59,283 --> 00:59:01,451
I wasn't hungry then, l was thirsty.

543
00:59:01,618 --> 00:59:03,286
Why you are so mean to me?

544
00:59:04,621 --> 00:59:07,790
-l'm not being mean. I'm preoccupied.
-What means "preoccupied"?

545
00:59:13,464 --> 00:59:15,48
That means preoccupied.

546
00:59:26,769 --> 00:59:28,770
Shoot the tires! Come on! Get him!

547
00:59:30,564 --> 00:59:33,149
-Get down!
-Shoot him!

548
00:59:43,827 --> 00:59:45,161
Bloody hell!

549
00:59:55,172 --> 00:59:56,464
Faster!

550
01:00:02,846 --> 01:00:04,514
Stop the car!

551
01:00:05,349 --> 01:00:06,641
Oh, shit!

552
01:01:11,582 --> 01:01:13,40
What are you doing?

553
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:14,709
You're so tense.

554
01:01:15,85 --> 01:01:17,128
You don't say.

555
01:01:21,675 --> 01:01:23,384
I make you relax, okay?

556
01:01:24,678 --> 01:01:27,555
-Yeah.
-l'm good at this.

557
01:01:27,973 --> 01:01:30,266
Making tense go away.

558
01:01:39,234 --> 01:01:40,443
What are you doing?

559
01:01:40,611 --> 01:01:45,406
I want to feel sex
one more time before l die.

560
01:01:45,574 --> 01:01:47,74
Don't you?

561
01:01:49,286 --> 01:01:51,787
What is it with you and dying?

562
01:01:53,165 --> 01:01:55,875
There is something wrong with me?

563
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:57,752
Am l not sexy?

564
01:01:59,87 --> 01:02:00,254
Yeah, you're sexy.

565
01:02:06,261 --> 01:02:07,303
You're the gay.

566
01:02:08,555 --> 01:02:11,807
Nope, I am not the gay.

567
01:02:11,975 --> 01:02:13,935
I don't mind.

568
01:02:16,21 --> 01:02:17,480
I'm not, okay?

569
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:22,568
Then what's the problem?

570
01:02:24,655 --> 01:02:28,491
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe I'm not in the mood?

571
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:49,345
-l thought rule is don't open package.
-lt is.

572
01:02:49,513 --> 01:02:51,222
Why you have rules
if you break them?

573
01:02:52,474 --> 01:02:54,183
I keep asking myself the same thing.

574
01:02:55,644 --> 01:02:57,687
Phone books.

575
01:03:06,29 --> 01:03:08,489
-You're the package.
-Yes.

576
01:03:09,491 --> 01:03:10,866
Could have said something.

577
01:03:11,368 --> 01:03:14,36
-Would it make a difference?
-Yes.

578
01:03:16,39 --> 01:03:17,456
Now what are you doing?

579
01:03:17,624 --> 01:03:20,84
You know, back in garage...

580
01:03:20,252 --> 01:03:25,172
...it was very turn-on to me
when you take off your clothes.

581
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:28,50
I was trying to keep five cretins
from caving my head in.

582
01:03:28,218 --> 01:03:29,677
I don't see the turn-on in that.

583
01:03:29,845 --> 01:03:34,932
You think it's only man
gets turned on by striptease?

584
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,184
I don't like where this
is going, Valentina.

585
01:03:37,352 --> 01:03:40,354
Would you striptease for me again?

586
01:03:41,23 --> 01:03:43,691
Give me the keys. This is not funny.

587
01:03:43,859 --> 01:03:45,26
You want keys?

588
01:03:49,531 --> 01:03:51,866
I want you to stop playing around,
is what I want.

589
01:03:52,34 --> 01:03:55,328
Maybe it's last chance to
play around for you and for me.

590
01:03:55,495 --> 01:03:58,39
This is not the time
or the place for playing.

591
01:03:58,206 --> 01:04:02,293
Why do l get feeling with you
it's never time or place?

592
01:04:02,461 --> 01:04:04,795
If l wanna get analyzed,
I'll see a psychiatrist.

593
01:04:04,963 --> 01:04:07,256
Now, give me the keys.

594
01:04:07,758 --> 01:04:10,92
Come on, Frank Martin.

595
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:12,553
Make playtime for me.

596
01:04:32,574 --> 01:04:35,117
All right? That enough?

597
01:04:35,285 --> 01:04:38,79
Not enough.
That is not a striptease, Frank.

598
01:04:38,246 --> 01:04:41,791
Striptease is sexy.
You know, move your ass a little.

599
01:04:42,125 --> 01:04:44,126
Come on, Frank Martin.

600
01:04:44,419 --> 01:04:46,337
You want keys?

601
01:04:46,713 --> 01:04:49,548
I want strip.

602
01:04:55,722 --> 01:04:58,349
You know what l'm gonna do to you
for making me do this?

603
01:04:58,517 --> 01:04:59,975
Spank me?

604
01:05:00,519 --> 01:05:01,811
For starters.

605
01:05:01,978 --> 01:05:04,605
-Tie me up?
-You'd like that, wouldn't you?

606
01:05:06,24 --> 01:05:08,651
I like the rough stuff.

607
01:05:11,988 --> 01:05:14,31
Really?

608
01:05:18,328 --> 01:05:21,122
Oh, but not too rough.

609
01:05:22,82 --> 01:05:24,500
Deal was a striptease for the keys.

610
01:05:24,668 --> 01:05:28,170
New deal. Kiss me for the keys.

611
01:05:35,762 --> 01:05:37,179
Like you mean it.

612
01:05:43,353 --> 01:05:46,564
Do you ever kiss
like you mean it, Frank?

613
01:05:47,691 --> 01:05:50,67
I'm thinking maybe not.

614
01:05:50,235 --> 01:05:52,528
I'm thinking you live alone.

615
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:55,489
Inside and outside.

616
01:05:56,241 --> 01:05:59,243
Thinking it is not dying
you're afraid of.

617
01:05:59,411 --> 01:06:01,328
It's living.

618
01:06:01,538 --> 01:06:03,122
Live with me.

619
01:06:03,290 --> 01:06:05,82
Just this once.

620
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:08,752
Just this moment. Live with me.

621
01:06:51,46 --> 01:06:53,5
-What's his position?
-We lost him.

622
01:06:55,91 --> 01:06:59,94
He headed into the mountains.
We can't get reception up there.

623
01:06:59,262 --> 01:07:01,680
Hack into one of the
military satellites.

624
01:07:08,855 --> 01:07:09,980
Yes.

625
01:07:10,148 --> 01:07:12,441
You think we're playing games here,
Mr. Minister?

626
01:07:12,609 --> 01:07:14,443
I don't know what
you're talking about.

627
01:07:14,611 --> 01:07:17,988
I'm talking about a black car full of
your incompetent operatives.

628
01:07:18,156 --> 01:07:21,283
One more move like that and you will
never see your daughter again.

629
01:07:21,451 --> 01:07:22,868
I want to hear her voice.

630
01:07:23,36 --> 01:07:25,704
When the contract
is signed and delivered.

631
01:07:25,872 --> 01:07:28,290
I will not sign until I hear her voice.

632
01:07:28,458 --> 01:07:31,126
You are in no position
to play hardball, Mr. Minister.

633
01:07:31,294 --> 01:07:33,963
Well, neither are you, Mr. Johnson.

634
01:07:35,48 --> 01:07:36,799
Yes, I know who you are.

635
01:07:37,133 --> 01:07:40,219
And l can assure you, if anything
happens to my daughter...

636
01:07:40,387 --> 01:07:42,304
...l will use all the power l have.

637
01:07:42,472 --> 01:07:47,935
I will hunt you down and make you pay
in a most hideous way for this.

638
01:07:51,314 --> 01:07:52,565
We have to move now.

639
01:07:58,697 --> 01:08:00,447
Pick up, Frank. Pick up.

640
01:08:17,424 --> 01:08:20,134
I'm in lbiza. Making holiday.

641
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:27,683
Someone hands me
glass of champagne.

642
01:08:27,851 --> 01:08:29,685
I drink.

643
01:08:30,395 --> 01:08:32,896
Then I don't feel so good.

644
01:08:45,827 --> 01:08:48,996
I go to bathroom, and next thing,
I'm awake in the car.

645
01:08:50,165 --> 01:08:54,1
I ask him, "Where is this?"
He tells me he's just a transporter.

646
01:08:57,839 --> 01:09:00,215
He's pretty good driver.

647
01:09:01,134 --> 01:09:03,344
Not like you good.

648
01:09:04,387 --> 01:09:10,225
I tell him, "Please.
My father a really powerful man.

649
01:09:10,393 --> 01:09:14,813
Big influence. Knows a lot of people.
Let me call him."

650
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:17,566
He's afraid.
He's never done this before.

651
01:09:18,318 --> 01:09:22,905
It's supposed to be simple.
Pick up, drop off. Easy money.

652
01:09:23,73 --> 01:09:26,450
He's been told no calls,
never leave car.

653
01:09:27,77 --> 01:09:28,827
But l convince him.

654
01:09:30,705 --> 01:09:32,373
I call.

655
01:09:32,999 --> 01:09:35,250
But before I say to my father
where we are....

656
01:09:35,418 --> 01:09:36,752
Inside the car. Come on!

657
01:09:43,426 --> 01:09:45,94
We get away, but....

658
01:09:48,264 --> 01:09:50,933
There's people shooting at us. Why?

659
01:09:51,101 --> 01:09:53,268
Why they shooting at us?

660
01:09:53,436 --> 01:09:58,399
He says they shoot because
we didn't go according to plan.

661
01:09:58,733 --> 01:10:03,237
I said, "Okay, that's the old plan.
What's new plan?"

662
01:10:03,405 --> 01:10:05,739
He says he has a friend.

663
01:10:14,624 --> 01:10:16,959
And then I met you.

664
01:10:19,713 --> 01:10:22,423
And then I feel it's gonna be okay.

665
01:10:26,970 --> 01:10:29,263
You didn't even know me.

666
01:10:29,973 --> 01:10:31,390
Of course I don't know you.

667
01:10:31,558 --> 01:10:35,102
I talk about feelings, not knowing.

668
01:10:37,188 --> 01:10:41,567
Well, if you was feeling that way, you
sure had a funny way of showing it.

669
01:10:42,318 --> 01:10:45,946
Better for a woman
to have a little mystery to her.

670
01:10:46,114 --> 01:10:47,614
No?

671
01:10:49,159 --> 01:10:50,659
No.

672
01:10:51,161 --> 01:10:54,496
Yes. Just a little.

673
01:11:20,857 --> 01:11:23,66
He's back on the radar, sir.

674
01:11:28,72 --> 01:11:30,32
-Yeah.
-Where the hell are you?

675
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:31,408
On the way to Bucharest.

676
01:11:31,701 --> 01:11:33,160
Not any longer.

677
01:11:35,205 --> 01:11:38,832
New coordinates: 3-7-1 3.

678
01:12:16,746 --> 01:12:18,539
Excuse me, Mr. Minister.

679
01:12:19,165 --> 01:12:21,375
Sorry, just a minute.

680
01:12:21,543 --> 01:12:23,669
Inspector Tarconi, from Marseilles.

681
01:12:25,255 --> 01:12:27,548
Well, not exactly Marseilles...

682
01:12:27,715 --> 01:12:30,676
-...but a small town to the east--
-What do you want, inspector?

683
01:12:30,844 --> 01:12:32,553
-A word with you.
-l have no time.

684
01:12:33,513 --> 01:12:35,13
It's about your daughter.

685
01:12:43,273 --> 01:12:46,900
Odessa, Frank. My country.

686
01:12:47,527 --> 01:12:50,654
You take me home. Thank you.

687
01:12:52,699 --> 01:12:54,616
What happened to Bucharest?

688
01:12:56,202 --> 01:13:01,81
-Change of plans.
-lt's a good change. l prefer Odessa.

689
01:13:01,708 --> 01:13:03,333
Yeah.

690
01:13:04,252 --> 01:13:07,421
I was looking forward to that fish
with the carrots myself.

691
01:13:07,589 --> 01:13:09,631
Oh, it's much better here.

692
01:13:09,799 --> 01:13:12,926
-You know chicken Kiev?
-l do.

693
01:13:13,94 --> 01:13:15,304
I know restaurant here.

694
01:13:15,471 --> 01:13:16,847
Best in the world.

695
01:13:17,15 --> 01:13:21,393
The chicken's so fresh.
And the butter, when it's coming out....

696
01:13:21,561 --> 01:13:23,729
Like you cannot believe, it's so nice.

697
01:13:29,402 --> 01:13:31,862
You know what l feel like now?

698
01:13:34,490 --> 01:13:36,199
Hungry.

699
01:13:39,329 --> 01:13:41,79
Safe.

700
01:13:48,671 --> 01:13:53,550
It's going to end up like the movies,
this happily ever after?

701
01:13:57,180 --> 01:13:59,848
By tonight, this is all
gonna be a fading memory.

702
01:14:00,308 --> 01:14:04,353
It's gonna be you and me,
laughing over chicken Kiev.

703
01:14:06,564 --> 01:14:07,981
Liar.

704
01:14:26,42 --> 01:14:28,210
Mr. Minister, an update, please.

705
01:14:29,879 --> 01:14:34,341
I am ready to sign the contract
once I speak to my daughter.

706
01:14:36,135 --> 01:14:39,54
Hello? Hello?

707
01:14:39,555 --> 01:14:42,224
Have that pen ready.
I'll call you back.

708
01:14:50,858 --> 01:14:53,68
-Yeah.
-We are closing the noose, Frank.

709
01:14:53,611 --> 01:14:56,989
Well, when it closes, make sure
no one tries to drag me out of the car.

710
01:14:57,156 --> 01:14:58,740
You know what this is about yet?

711
01:14:59,909 --> 01:15:02,452
The girl. Her father.

712
01:15:02,745 --> 01:15:05,330
Large amounts of toxic waste.

713
01:15:05,498 --> 01:15:07,874
It is a trade.
His signature for her life.

714
01:15:09,585 --> 01:15:12,671
I have a reputation
to uphold here, inspector.

715
01:15:12,839 --> 01:15:16,91
One hundred percent
successful delivery rate.

716
01:15:16,259 --> 01:15:19,761
Am l detecting a little attachment?

717
01:15:20,263 --> 01:15:25,559
That is not the Frank I know. With his
rules, no names, no attachment.

718
01:15:25,727 --> 01:15:27,936
Why is everyone so concerned
about my rules?

719
01:15:28,604 --> 01:15:34,276
Frank, l always suspected
you are a romantic at heart.

720
01:15:36,195 --> 01:15:37,237
Anything else?

721
01:15:38,406 --> 01:15:40,115
Where is the rendezvous?

722
01:15:40,283 --> 01:15:42,242
I'll call you back.

723
01:15:46,956 --> 01:15:49,624
-Yeah.
-We're almost at the end, Frank.

724
01:15:49,792 --> 01:15:52,377
-Just give me the coordinates.
-No more coordinates.

725
01:15:53,46 --> 01:15:55,88
The road you're on.

726
01:15:55,381 --> 01:15:56,757
Make your first left.

727
01:15:57,508 --> 01:15:59,51
I'd like to know where l'm going.

728
01:16:03,806 --> 01:16:06,308
You'll know when you get there.

729
01:16:36,297 --> 01:16:38,590
Don't worry. We got them
right where we want them.

730
01:16:45,515 --> 01:16:47,516
My compliments, Frank.

731
01:16:47,683 --> 01:16:51,353
Our trust in your abilities
was well deserved.

732
01:16:51,854 --> 01:16:53,688
If you could please
send the girl out.

733
01:16:55,358 --> 01:16:56,858
She's coming.

734
01:16:57,193 --> 01:16:59,361
I'm not coming.

735
01:17:00,29 --> 01:17:02,197
They need you. They won't kill you.

736
01:17:02,365 --> 01:17:04,699
But they will kill you.

737
01:17:05,201 --> 01:17:08,495
Do I look like a man who came halfway
across Europe to die on a bridge?

738
01:17:10,706 --> 01:17:11,706
Do I?

739
01:17:20,967 --> 01:17:23,468
We don't have all day, Frank.

740
01:17:27,265 --> 01:17:28,890
Look how many of them.

741
01:17:29,58 --> 01:17:31,17
They have all the guns.

742
01:17:31,185 --> 01:17:32,394
How it's gonna be okay?

743
01:17:36,524 --> 01:17:37,858
Tell you over dinner.

744
01:17:39,485 --> 01:17:40,735
Now, go.

745
01:17:41,654 --> 01:17:42,904
Go.

746
01:17:43,72 --> 01:17:44,865
Kiss me.

747
01:18:01,716 --> 01:18:03,258
Go.

748
01:18:08,97 --> 01:18:10,682
You're gonna get me killed. Now, go.

749
01:18:35,333 --> 01:18:37,584
Get to her, you bastard.

750
01:19:02,902 --> 01:19:04,986
Better now, darling?

751
01:19:23,422 --> 01:19:24,965
Finish him.

752
01:19:44,443 --> 01:19:46,778
No! Frank!

753
01:19:58,40 --> 01:20:00,542
His beloved car will be his grave.

754
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:03,628
Leaves it, he blows. Stays, he drowns.
Let's get out of here.

755
01:20:14,849 --> 01:20:16,891
-Tarconi.
-They have the girl.

756
01:20:18,102 --> 01:20:21,563
Frank, we are trying to track him
through the phone signal.

757
01:20:21,731 --> 01:20:24,24
-Where are you?
-ln a lake.

758
01:20:25,234 --> 01:20:26,901
A lake?

759
01:20:27,361 --> 01:20:29,237
Can you be more specific?

760
01:20:29,405 --> 01:20:30,739
There's a dam.

761
01:20:32,366 --> 01:20:34,326
-A dam?
-l know the place, sir.

762
01:20:34,493 --> 01:20:36,328
-How far?
-Ten minutes at least.

763
01:20:36,537 --> 01:20:38,413
Frank, we'll be there in 1 0 minutes.

764
01:20:38,581 --> 01:20:39,914
Can you make it any faster?

765
01:20:40,333 --> 01:20:42,667
-We'll do our best.
-Thank you.

766
01:22:41,78 --> 01:22:42,620
Buy tickets for all of us.

767
01:22:43,205 --> 01:22:44,622
Where to?

768
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:48,751
Anywhere this train is going. We need
to keep moving for half an hour.

769
01:22:48,919 --> 01:22:50,879
Why don't we just keep
driving around?

770
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:57,927
Another day.

771
01:23:12,401 --> 01:23:14,944
Sir! There!

772
01:23:32,129 --> 01:23:36,341
-Out. Out!
-Everybody out!

773
01:23:36,509 --> 01:23:37,926
-Come on.
-Move!

774
01:23:38,677 --> 01:23:40,261
Move, quick!

775
01:23:58,197 --> 01:23:59,906
-Mr. Minister?
-Yes.

776
01:24:00,491 --> 01:24:02,242
Someone wants to talk to you.

777
01:24:03,536 --> 01:24:06,246
-Papa.
-Are you all right?

778
01:24:10,793 --> 01:24:12,460
Don't sign.

779
01:24:13,128 --> 01:24:16,256
What you have is 1 5 minutes.

780
01:24:23,472 --> 01:24:26,224
-You ever find out what this is about?
-Garbage.

781
01:24:26,392 --> 01:24:27,976
How much garbage are we talking?

782
01:24:28,852 --> 01:24:32,480
Enough to pollute half the country
for a hundred years.

783
01:24:32,648 --> 01:24:33,648
Try it again.

784
01:24:54,336 --> 01:24:57,714
For a modern woman,
you are very uninformed.

785
01:24:57,965 --> 01:24:59,674
This is the new world.

786
01:25:00,801 --> 01:25:03,94
There are no more countries.
That's old think.

787
01:25:03,512 --> 01:25:06,889
There are just economic realities.
Profit and loss.

788
01:25:07,57 --> 01:25:09,851
Efficiency and waste.

789
01:25:10,19 --> 01:25:12,20
Think global, not local.

790
01:25:12,813 --> 01:25:14,772
Think this.

791
01:25:29,538 --> 01:25:31,539
-Yes?
-Where are we?

792
01:25:39,131 --> 01:25:40,673
We're almost there.

793
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:44,677
Where?

794
01:25:44,845 --> 01:25:46,888
Here. He is on a train.

795
01:25:47,514 --> 01:25:49,891
-And where are we?
-Here.

796
01:25:50,59 --> 01:25:52,268
We can get units there.

797
01:25:53,896 --> 01:25:55,730
That's a good idea. Do that.

798
01:25:59,693 --> 01:26:02,570
Oh, Frank, come on.

799
01:26:34,436 --> 01:26:37,21
Mr. Minister, l assure you,
everything is in order.

800
01:26:37,189 --> 01:26:39,107
I'm sure it is.

801
01:26:39,483 --> 01:26:43,361
-lf there are any problems....
-l know you will solve them.

802
01:26:44,279 --> 01:26:46,197
Now, if you don't mind....

803
01:27:16,562 --> 01:27:20,148
You might not believe this,
but I am, at heart, a pacifist.

804
01:27:21,358 --> 01:27:23,484
I hate violence.

805
01:27:25,446 --> 01:27:28,281
It creates more problems
than it solves.

806
01:27:29,867 --> 01:27:32,744
You know, I never wanted
to do any of this.

807
01:27:34,204 --> 01:27:37,331
A client asked me to obtain a result...

808
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:39,876
...so l went about creating
an environment...

809
01:27:40,43 --> 01:27:41,836
...with the least amount
of bloodshed.

810
01:27:42,4 --> 01:27:44,797
No one wanted to cooperate.
Not you, not the first driver...

811
01:27:44,965 --> 01:27:48,760
...not your father, not the
recently deceased Frank Martin.

812
01:27:49,845 --> 01:27:52,472
Everyone wanted to fight.

813
01:28:07,821 --> 01:28:09,30
What's so funny?

814
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,784
Hearing a dead man talking.

815
01:30:25,626 --> 01:30:27,585
One more step, Frank.

816
01:30:28,3 --> 01:30:29,545
Come on. One more.

817
01:31:13,131 --> 01:31:14,590
Look.

818
01:31:14,925 --> 01:31:16,8
It's over.

819
01:31:16,885 --> 01:31:18,552
Two minutes to 9. He signed.

820
01:31:22,349 --> 01:31:24,475
Oh, my God.

821
01:31:29,731 --> 01:31:31,190
No, Frank. No, no.

822
01:32:12,149 --> 01:32:14,608
It's over, Frank. lt's over.

823
01:32:15,861 --> 01:32:18,362
Mission accomplished.
You and the girl are free to go.

824
01:32:19,948 --> 01:32:22,283
Matter of fact,
I'm so impressed by your talent...

825
01:32:22,451 --> 01:32:24,160
...l'd like to offer you a position.

826
01:32:24,327 --> 01:32:27,663
I'd like to offer you one.
Permanently disabled.

827
01:32:46,933 --> 01:32:48,309
I hate to waste talent.

828
01:32:48,477 --> 01:32:50,811
But l really don't think
we'd make a very good fit.

829
01:32:50,979 --> 01:32:52,480
That's right.

830
01:33:16,254 --> 01:33:17,379
No!

831
01:33:21,301 --> 01:33:24,512
We wouldn't fit, but you and the
bracelet were made for each other.

832
01:33:29,17 --> 01:33:30,351
No, no.

833
01:33:41,613 --> 01:33:45,533
No!

834
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:03,134
You're doing the right thing.

835
01:34:22,946 --> 01:34:31,78
Valentina.

836
01:34:41,381 --> 01:34:43,549
Am l in heaven?

837
01:34:46,636 --> 01:34:48,929
Looks more like we're in hell.

838
01:34:49,431 --> 01:34:51,265
I don't care.

839
01:34:51,558 --> 01:34:53,267
As long as we're there together.

840
01:35:05,572 --> 01:35:06,655
Yes?

841
01:35:06,823 --> 01:35:10,34
Mr. Minister,
your daughter is in good hands.

842
01:35:11,494 --> 01:35:13,120
Thank you.

843
01:35:27,636 --> 01:35:30,54
-What are you doing?
-What you said, the right thing.

844
01:35:30,222 --> 01:35:33,474
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a conference to address...

845
01:35:33,642 --> 01:35:36,644
...on the dangers of doing business
with people like you.

846
01:35:36,811 --> 01:35:37,811
Thank you very much.

847
01:35:56,998 --> 01:35:58,40
Is the launch ready?

848
01:35:58,208 --> 01:36:00,584
-lt's on the water, sir, waiting.
-Time to leave.

849
01:36:01,294 --> 01:36:02,670
-Grab the log.
-Okay.

850
01:36:21,731 --> 01:36:24,650
I just don't understand it.

851
01:36:24,818 --> 01:36:26,819
When I was a boy, my father and I...

852
01:36:26,987 --> 01:36:30,364
...used to pull fish out of
this very spot all day long.

853
01:36:30,532 --> 01:36:32,199
Times change, inspector.

854
01:36:32,742 --> 01:36:34,535
As do people.

855
01:36:37,497 --> 01:36:39,456
You referring to me?

856
01:36:41,1 --> 01:36:43,127
I don't think that's
a very accurate statement.

857
01:36:44,45 --> 01:36:46,297
I drive the same car,
live in the same house.

858
01:36:46,464 --> 01:36:50,634
Oh, l was not referring
to your car or your house.

859
01:36:53,471 --> 01:36:55,889
The sea is so restful.

860
01:36:56,57 --> 01:36:57,224
Is lunch ready yet?

861
01:36:58,476 --> 01:37:01,812
Mademoiselle, there is
a certain progression to things.

862
01:37:01,980 --> 01:37:05,357
In order to eat the lunch,
you first have to catch the lunch.

863
01:37:05,525 --> 01:37:07,776
And if we keep talking
instead of concentrating...

864
01:37:07,944 --> 01:37:09,320
...we're gonna catch nothing.

865
01:37:09,487 --> 01:37:13,240
I have better idea. Why we
don't skip catching of lunch...

866
01:37:13,408 --> 01:37:15,409
...and go right to eating of lunch?

867
01:37:15,577 --> 01:37:18,746
I know wonderful place
just up coast from here...

868
01:37:18,913 --> 01:37:21,874
...where they make fish stew.
Incredible.

869
01:37:22,42 --> 01:37:27,838
They use tomatoes and onions,
and little amount of wild lavender.

870
01:37:28,506 --> 01:37:30,424
What kind of wine?

871
01:37:30,592 --> 01:37:32,384
Pink. From south.

872
01:37:33,636 --> 01:37:35,512
A Châteauneuf, perhaps.

873
01:37:35,930 --> 01:37:38,432
-Chilled.
-Of course, chilled.

874
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,559
And for dessert?
